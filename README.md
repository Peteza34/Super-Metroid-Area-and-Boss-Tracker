# Super-Metroid-Area-and-Boss-Tracker

This is an area and boss tracker for the Super Metroid Randomizer. It is not as feature rich as the one on the VARIA website, but it is compact and is designed to fit next to a windowed emulator on the same monitor. Windows users can download the executable on the releases page. Mac and linux users can run it from source code. Just run main.py. You will need Pygame installed in your environment.

The controls are simple, you either left click stuff or right click stuff. You will figure it out I am sure.

Let me know if there are any questions or issues. SentientFlatbread#8132 on Discord.
