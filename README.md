# Super-Metroid-Area-and-Boss-Tracker

This is an area and boss tracker for the Super Metroid Randomizer. It is not as feature rich as the one on the VARIA website, but it is compact and is designed to fit next to a windowed emulator on the same monitor. To run the tracker, simply run main.py. You will need Pygame installed in your environment. Windows users can also head to the releases page and download an executable version of the tracker.

The controls are simple, you either left click stuff or right click stuff. You will figure it out I am sure.

Let me know if there are any questions or issues. SentientFlatbread#8132 on Discord.
